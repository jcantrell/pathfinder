# Sudoku in javascript
This is a visualization for pathfinding algorithms.
The goal of this project is to give me a way to learn basic javascript and
possibly jQuery.

# How to use

## To-do
- [x] Draw grid
- [x] Allow placing of start and end points
- [x] Allow drawing of obstacles
- [x] Implement at least one pathfinding algorithm
- [x] Control algorithm step by step (allow 'stepping functionality')
- [x] Add run-to-completion functionality (rather than just step-by-step)
- [x] Draw visualization on each step
- [ ] Move board tracking stuff (start, end, path, blocked, etc) to twoDSpace
